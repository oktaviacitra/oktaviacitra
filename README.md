I am Oktavia Citra Resmi Rachmawati, an active learner that very enthusiastic about iOS app development and machine learning. I used to join <b>Apple Developer Academy | UC</b> and <b>Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka in 2020</b>. I started my programming journey in 2017, but I decided to focus on that two fields in 2020. My current interest is making an iOS app that has a clean architecture and good quality code to give a long-term solution for many people. Besides that, I'm currently working on the research of an image search and visual recommendation system.
